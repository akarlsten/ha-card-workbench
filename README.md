<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench/master/screenshots/workbench.png)

I couldn't find a nice way of playing around with state values while being able to live refresh the card
while working on custom Home Assistant cards. This workbench is a solution to both of those problems.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Online Workbench

Go to [the live workbench](https://workbench.dangre.co).

Disable protection for the site (otherwise it won't be able 
to load the card script):

![disable protection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench/master/screenshots/fixblock.png)


### Local Workbench

#### Clone the repository:

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench && cd ha-card-workbench
```

#### Install dependencies:
```zsh
$ yarn install
```

#### Start server:
```zsh
$ yarn dev
```


## Features/Usage

### Entities Editor/Viewer
![Entities Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench/master/screenshots/entitiesEditor.png)

#### Entities
This editor is for modifying/viewing entity states. Disconnected from HASS, you can write and read mock values.
If you are connected to HASS, the view will change to a JSON tree in read-only mode. (If you want to modify your HASS values, simply disconnect from HASS, and the workbench will remember all the entity states.)

#### Connection
In the top right corner there is a button to enable a connection to your HASS server for real-time entity access.

### Card Config Editor
![Config Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench/master/screenshots/configEditor.png)

This editing window lets you edit your card's configuration in the same way that you would normally.


### Workbench Config
![Workbench Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench/master/screenshots/workbenchConfig.png)

This panel allows you to set the location of your card's JS file. If you are on the online workbench and this is not working,
please see above on disabling site protection.

There are two "Name" inputs: one for the card's element name (e.g. `threedy-card`) and the other for the configuration
carc's element name (e.g. `threedy-config-card`).
