<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dangreco/ha-card-workbench/master/screenshots/workbench.png)

I couldn't find a nice way of playing around with state values while being able to live refresh the card
while working on custom Home Assistant cards. This workbench is a solution to both of those problems.
